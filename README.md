## About me

I'm Marceli, a guy from Poland who loves programming and board games. <br>
I would describe myself as a passionate, curious, and diligent individual (with emphasis on curious). <br>
I'm also pragmatic, and generally don't tend to care about looks (it definitely shows with how deprived of visuals this README is).

I deeply care about my craft, and therefore consider myself a life-long learner. <br>
I always seek to improve, learn new things, understand new concepts, and apply them in practice. <br>
Simply put, there's no destination that I'm striving towards, no end goal that I wish to achieve. <br>
I'm just constantly pushing myself to new heights with each passing day. <br>
Slowly, methodically becoming the best possible version of myself.

Despite sometimes coming off as this introvertic weirdo, I'm quite the opposite (at least with the introvert part). <br>
I'm actually a very communicative and open person. <br>
I love having conversations and greatly appreciate questions (of any kind), so please feel free to ask them.

## Technologies

Honestly, there's no point in listing the ones I use/love as this list changes so often. <br>
I mean, knowing that three years ago I doubled in MySQL and did some database modeling won't give you much. <br>
For all intents and purposes, this info can be already outdated, I may have already forgotten 90% of what I did (and I did).

That being said, I mostly do web development. <br>
I enjoy working on both fronts, and I'm not the type to lock myself into a specific technology stack. <br>
I evaluate and assess project needs, and based on them choose the tools (some folks got it reversed).

I also dip my toes in game development from time to time. <br>
I tried several engines, and ultimately [godot](https://godotengine.org) took the cake for me. <br>
It's simple, FOSS, easy to start with, and much more powerful and capable than I'll ever need it to be.

I may not be a game developer (and likely never will be), but the ability to create these self-enclosed tiny experiences that I can share with my loved ones turned out to be a tremendous help when dealing with burnout. <br>
There's just something magical about the interactivity of this medium. <br>
Well-told stories hit much harder when you're a part of them, rather than just a spectator. <br>
Games are the reason why I started programming in the first place, and for that, they hold a very special place in my heart.

## My late-night rambling...

**Note:** It was pitch black when I wrote this (and apparently was in a mood for pathos), so don't take it too seriously, I realize that it comes off a bit cliche/corny.

Programmers are a bizarre breed. <br>
In many ways, they're artists, artisans, and magicians at the same time. <br>
To them merely "good" is never enough. <br>
It oft seems to me that being a programmer is intrinsically tied to being stuck in this never-ending pursuit of greatness. <br>
It feels like the underlying dynamic of being a developer is an infinite loop with no break statements. <br>
There are always new things to learn, libraries, frameworks, languages, tools, methodologies, and the list goes on... <br>
It's hard to keep up, yet we do. <br>
We continuously choose to improve, adapt and evolve. <br>
After all, what else can kill developer's career as swiftly and effectively as stagnation?

This is a field where brilliant lunatics, charming madmen, and exceptionally minded individuals abound. <br>
It's truly an amazing profession built by an incredible set of individuals. <br>
Filled to the brim with helpful open-minded people. <br>
I'm just grateful that I had the support I needed to get to this point, to be a part of this community.

All that for me to say that I feel empowered by being a programmer, I view it as a great privilege, and perhaps foolishly derive my sense of self-worth from it.
